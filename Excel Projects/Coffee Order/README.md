## My Approach to Solve this Problem
There are many obervations we can look at by analyzing this data such as top 5 customers, sales by country, etc. The main scope of this project is to demostrate my dashboard skills using Excel.  

## Technical Approach in This Project
- Initial pre-processing
    - Excel Formulas: IF(), XLOOKUP(), INDEX(), MATCH() 
    - Populating the orders sheet with the customers and products sheets
    - end result is a dataset that I can use for visualization and analysis
    

- Feature cleaning & engineering
    - Here I format the date, and numbers to get ready for Analysis and to check/remove duplicates


- Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Excel Features: Tables, Pivot Tables/Charts
    - Utilize Tables and Pivot Tables to make the visualizations to be put in the dashboard.
