## About the Dataset
- This dataset contains road accident data from different incidents.
- There are 307973 observations and 21 features, with each row being a different person.
- After adding two features it now toals 23.
- You can find the data publicly available here: [[TITLERoad Accident Data]]([(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116890999875311477003&rtpof=true&sd=true)])

## Notebook Navigation


## My Approach to Solve this Problem
There are many obervations we can look at by analyzing this data such as total casualties, road conditions etc. The main scope of this project is to demonstrate my dashboard skills using Excel.  

## Technical Approach in This Project
- Initial pre-processing
    - Checking over the data using a filter to see if any feautures needed to be fixed and/or cleaned
    

- Feature cleaning & engineering
    - Cleaned the data mainly using the replace all


- Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Excel Features: Tables, Pivot Tables/Charts
    - Utilize Tables and Pivot Tables to make the visualizations to be put in the dashboard.



## Limitations of Analysis


## Data Cleaning
- Accident_Severity had a typo "fetal" and should be "fatal" using the replace all.
