## Notebook Navigation


## My Approach to Solve this Problem
There are many obervations we can look at by analyzing this data such as Covid Deaths in each country. The main scope of this project is to demonstrate my SQL skills and to apply them to an excel document to put them on Tableau.  

## Technical Approach in This Project


## Limitations of Analysis


## Data Cleaning
- The biggest cleaning was splitting the data into two different datasets, Covid Deaths, and Covid Vaccinations.
