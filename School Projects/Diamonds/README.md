# Mental Health in the Tech Field 2016


## Introduction to the Project
This project I did in my Data Mining and Machine Learning Course using R-Studio and the objective is to report on which model is the best to be used in predicting the price of diamonds.

## About the Dataset
- This dataset contains 9 differnt properties of diamonds along with the price of a particular diamond.
- There are 53,940 observations and 10 features, with each row being a different diamond.
- You can find the data publicly available here: [[Diamonds]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds)

## Notebook Navigation


## My Approach to Solve this Problem
The focus on the project is to predict the price so I chose the response variable as the price and the 9 other variables as the predictor variables 

I will be focusing on quantitative data


## Technical Approach in This Project
- Initial pre-processing and Feature cleaning & engineering
    - Libraries: None
    - Not much to do other than change some variables to 'factor'  data types and put it in a linear regression model
    - end result is a dataset that I can use for visualization and analysis

- Exploratory Data Analysis (WIP)
    - 
    
- Modeling
    - Libraries: ISLR, leaps, MASS
    - Did two types of analysis, multiple regression with best subsets and robust regression and then did Double-Cross Validation to see which is the best.
    - Also made two visuals (a before and after transformation) of a Normal Q-Q plot to help compare which model is the best. 

## Limitations of Analysis


## Data Cleaning
The only cleaning I needed to do whas to change some variables to the factor type
