# Mental Health in the Tech Field 2016

(INSERT LINK IF Applicable)

## Introduction to the Project
This project explores how sentiment analysis is helpful in various types of organizations. retail (Amazon), healthcare, and education are the three areas this paper will explore, but the techniques and results can be used in other areas. With the growth of social media and online presence, people are expressing their opinions daily. Sentiment analysis can help determine whether something is negative, neutral, or positive right away and not have to read every single review or tweet. Using an amazon dataset and gathering tweets using the Twitter API, I conducted sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) and RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach) methods and then compared them. The comparison results were largely the same, with the RoBERTa method being more accurate due to being a more powerful tool. Overall, the results will help show that organizations should utilize sentiment analysis to have a better relationship with their customers or clients.

## About the Dataset
- This project uses 3 different datasets Prime Pantry, Healthcare tweets, and Education Tweets.
- Prime Pantry 
    - This dataset contains mental health related information in the tech industy in 2016
    - There are ??? observations and ??? features, with each row being a different person.
    - After adding some features, it now has ?? features.
    - You can find the Prime Pantry data publicly available here under the "Small" subsets for experimentation 5-core: [[Prime Pantry]](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/)
Healthcare Tweets
    - This dataset contains tweets with the hashtag #healthcare using a Twitter API
    - There are ??? observations and ??? features, with each row being a differnt person.
    - After removing some observation through cleaning, it now has ??? observations.
    - You can find the Healthcare Tweets data publicly available here under my data folder on my Github: [[Healthcare Tweets]](INSERT LINK)
Education
    - This dataset contains This dataset contains tweets with the hashtag #education using a Twitter API
    - There are ??? observations and ??? features, with each row being a different person.
    - After removing some observation through cleaning, it now has ??? observations.
    - You can find the Education Tweets data publicly available here under my data folder on my Github: [[Education Tweets]](INSERT LING)


## Notebook Navigation


## My Approach to Solve this Problem
My approach was to take the reviews or the text of the observations and run it through 2 different types of Sentiment Analysis and determine if it is positive, neutral, or negative and comparing it to the number of stars or 


## Technical Approach in This Project
- Feature cleaning & engineering


- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Modeling
    -  pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
    - quick baseline models are implemented and feature importances are calculated and visualized
    - the first set of predictions are also visualized in a scatter mapbox (plotly) that display the predicted frequency of breaks for a test set of pipe segments
